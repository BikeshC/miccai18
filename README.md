# Ipynb version  of "Evaluating surgical skills from kinematic data using convolutional neural networks"

This modified project of @https://github.com/hfawaz/miccai18
cause I don't have a good hardware (GPU) for running this code by directly, I used "Google's Colaboratory".

you don't need any setup for the run, just refer this Repo to Colab website http://colab.research.google.com and find the miccai18.ipynb.

*notice that processing need around 2 hours.*
